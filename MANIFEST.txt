All Arduino-related code is in `Ardunio Stuff`, and all Processing-related code is in `Processing Stuff` (as expected).


Current Setup
=============

working code for code that is not final
processing - POOLSIDE
arduino - ONBOARD

Processing setup
================
Need to be using Processing 2 (not 3)
need 64 bit version of one of the procontroll library files from here:
http://ci.newdawnsoftware.com/job/JInput-git/3488/label=OSX/ (libjinput-osx.jnilib)
Controller name = "Wireless 360 Controller"


Coding Conventions
==================
camelCase for variables and function names
CAPITALS_WITH_UNDERSCORE for constants
tabwidth = 4
